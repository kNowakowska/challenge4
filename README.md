# challenge4
4th challenge of the WebDevWeeklyChallenge. 

It is the part of simple page which layout is based on tiles. The project uses icons supplied by layout authors and photos (in slider) from https://www.pexels.com/pl-pl/ .
Intruduced slider came from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp . 

The main purpose of implementing page wasn't creating own slider and layout but training using HTML and CSS, and correct deployment of provided slider. 
Another target was to use SCSS precompiler with all its features. There is also some microdata created with the use of https://schema.org/ .
There are used media queries to provide quite good appearance of page on different screens. 
Page isn't much interactive, there's only interactive slider and follow buttons which change when clicked. 

The app is available on GitHubPages:  https://knowakowska.github.io/challenge4/

Future ideas:
-- aria labels 
-- clickable navigation bar 
-- showing up menu on small screens
